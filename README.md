# Cloning API (FastAPI)

This project provides a RESTful API for cloning operations using FastAPI. The API exposes endpoints to perform cloning-related tasks, making it easy to integrate with other applications or automate workflows.

## Features

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Endpoints for cloning operations
- Easy to extend and integrate

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the API

To start the API server, run:
```bash
uvicorn cloning_api:app --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0
```
- `cloning_api.py` should be in the project root
- The API will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Usage

- Access the interactive API docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).
- Use the provided endpoints to perform cloning operations.

## Project Structure

- `cloning_api.py`: Main FastAPI application with cloning endpoints.
- `README.md`: Documentation and usage instructions.
